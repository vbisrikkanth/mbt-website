## Compare

- In traditional automation testing, we write test case. We must think about how many test cases are enough to cover the feature we want to test.
- In model based testing, we describe the feature as models. The tool we use will generate and execute them for us.
- By using model based testing, we can focus on business logic (by defining models), save time from writing and executing test cases. The tool will take care of generating test cases.
