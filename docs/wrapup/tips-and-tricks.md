Tips and tricks

1. Try to split into small models
    1. To make model less complicated
    2. To increase testing speed
2. We can only edit title of tasks and bugs
3. If bug's replicate steps is too long, try to reduce with another path reducer (e.g. transition path reducer)
4. If the bug is closed, try to test it again (to make sure it's actually fixed)
