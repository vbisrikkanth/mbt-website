Since the [first commit](https://github.com/tienvx/mbt-bundle/commit/a99f295e4b33bb7b5c9b1de0f75d8066702cef63) at Oct 14, 2017, we work hard to deliver the first alpha version.

This version contains:
* Initial code
* Core plugins + allow to extend functionality via custom plugins
* Support adding workers to speed up testing
* Add example models

We decide to use Symfony 4 framework that will be released in couple of months. We choose Symfony because of not only it is stable and well-documented, but also it provide features that help us speed up development:
* Flex: help generate and organize configuration
* Workflow: define business logic in friendly format
* Messenger: help testing quicker by divide it into jobs, so that we can add more workers to execute jobs
